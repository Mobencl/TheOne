# TheOne
DÃ©veloppement web


# This part is done except for the middlewares
# The account part:
* Registration form for the partner and the player/done
* login /logout /done
* There are going to be two middlewares: One for the partner and one for the normal user(the player) to deny access 
to some pages for each user  --It should be done the last two weeks before the presentation--

# For the partner:
* He can add Terrains with a photo for each terrain/done
* Show The terrains for the partner/done
* A partner can delete one of his terrains/done
* I can show the availibility form so the user can add availibilities but I'm still working on saving that into the database /done
* Show availibilities to the partner /done


# For the user:(Functions)

--this should be done this week 4 august--
* Start Booking/ done
* Show Sportcenters with details/done
* Show Terrains of each sportcenter with availibilities/done but I still can't display the date and the time from the datetimefield/done
* make a booking(conditions for Booking in progress):
Two models : /Booking/(deleted) and Booking_inprogress   - Only one model-Booking_inprogress 



# This part is what it should be done till the end of the internship


* When a user starts a booking and doesn't finish it, he should be able to finish it wihout having to redo all the process == Working on it 
*The new availibility of the terrain is saved intothe database for every terrain



-- This should  after the internship if I don't finish the booking in progress part.
* Add guests to the booking(I'm going to create an other class called Guests(Still thinking about that)


--Nouveaux objectifs--
change the widgets for the datetimefiels
Add a condition so a user can't have the same availibility time for the terrains
* Paiement plateform
